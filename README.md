# solitario
Solitaire made in Java. It's a NetBeans project. I made this for an assignment
at college. Actually, for two assignments. It was a console program first and then
I converted it to a graphical game. Also it's in spanish.

Instructions: You have to put the cards in descending order, from K to A, to collect
them and clear the board. If you can't do any other moves, open the 'Acci√≥n' menu and
select 'Repartir' to add a new hand of cards. You can only do this 5 times. You can 
start a new game by selecting 'Nuevo juego' from the action menu.

Probably not the best instructions, you should google it if you don't know how to play.

Enjoy it!
